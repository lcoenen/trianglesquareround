TvRvS is a little 2D fighting game. It's written mostly in Coffeescript and use Jquery UI and [KiwiJS](http://www.kiwijs.org/)

# Get started

To launch the server, you'll need to install grunt-cli, coffeescript, express and mocha globally. Once you're done, just install dependancies using npm

    npm install
				grunt

and then use your favorite browser (tested on chromium 59.0.3071) to open localhost:8080
